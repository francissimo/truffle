-----------------------


Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. With Truffle, you get:

* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
* Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
* Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication.
* Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
* External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

| ℹ️ **Contributors**: Please see the [Development](#development) section of this README. |

### Install

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

*Note: To avoid any strange permissions errors, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).*

### Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
$ truffle init
```

From there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands  above. If you'd like to [configure a more advanced development environment](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/advanced/configuration) we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running `npm install -g ganache-cli` at the command line.

+  [ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache): a command-line version of Truffle's blockchain server.
+  [ganache-ui](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-ui): A GUI for the server that displays your transaction history and chain state.
